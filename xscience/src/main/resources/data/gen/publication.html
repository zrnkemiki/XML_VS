      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      Have you ever searched for an apartment? It`s not such an easy task. Leaving the
      problems of what is there on the marked aside, there are so much difficult choices
      to be
      made. Should you buy/rent a newly built apartment or not? How many rooms should the
      apartment have? In what condition are the installations if it`s not new? Should you
      search for
      a furnished apartment or not? What are your neighbors in the apartment building like?
      What
      is the neighborhood like? Are there stores and coffee shops nearby? Playgrounds, schools,
      hospitals, farmer`s market? Does the neighborhood have a crime problem? Should it
      be closer
      of further away from your workplace? What about parking space? Vicinity to the main
      roads
      and boulevards? This search is further complicated if you are a smoker. If renting,
      it is not
      just whether the landlord allows smoking inside but also the matter of whether or
      not in the
      vicinity of the apartment exit coffee shops which “look the other way” when it comes
      to the
      no-smoking-inside law. In similar situation are pet-owners.
      Finding the right apartment requires thinking on a number of questions, trying to
      satisfy
      as much as possible and it necessarily involves some trade-offs in the end. The quest
      for
      finding the right apartment can be thought of, to a certain point, as an interesting
      analogy to
      Geopolitical analysis. And as seen above, similarly to Geopolitical analysis the quest
      for an
      apartment has a lot to do with location. No matter how well furnished and beautiful
      inside,
      the prices of apartments are always higher at better locations. Of course, unlike
      political
      entities, people can move and chose the location in which they wish to live, and this
      is where
      the analogy ends. But both raise the question of what makes a location good?
      
      <h2>Methodological Framework</h2>
      Establishing a methodological foothold for conducting such a research is critical
      for
      maintaining its validity. Literature-assessing research like Kenneth Waltz`s done
      in his book

      <h2>Concept Formation</h2>
      The dual purpose of concept formation within this research requires elaborating on
      concept formation from the view point of first and second research question. Undoubtedly,
      ways how one formulates a concept which has merit and validity for conducting research
      encompasses the second research question more directly.
